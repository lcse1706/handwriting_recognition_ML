# Handwriting Recognition App

This web app allows users to upload an image containing handwritten text, and it uses a deep learning model to recognize and predict the text from the image.

## Key Features

- **Image Upload**: Easily upload images with handwritten text for recognition.
- **Text Prediction**: The app uses a pre-trained deep learning model to process and predict the text.
- **Results Display**: Once processed, the predicted text is displayed on the screen for you to review.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A simple Python framework for building the web application.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning libraries used to build and run the handwriting recognition model.
- **Pillow**: Python library for handling and processing images.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to create and style the frontend of the app.
